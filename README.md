# wp-turbolinks

[Turbolinks](https://github.com/rails/turbolinks/) extracted from Rails, for use with WordPress.

Also includes [jquery.turbolinks](https://github.com/kossnocorp/jquery.turbolinks) for jQuery support.

The idea is to just enable the plugin and make your blog faster. Sites with heavy JavaScript may have some problems, and is not necessarily recommended.

There are probably a lot of bugs. Please report them!
